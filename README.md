# Coding Geometric Art
This project aims to use code to recreate existing geometric art. The artworks are inspired by/recreations of Frank Stella's art.
Each shape, pattern and iteration represents the dialogue between human intention and computational logic, illustrating how algorithms can produce aesthetic outcomes that are a mix of systematic and expressive. By creating art with code, I challenged my previous ideal that generative art was invalid/lacked creativity.

## General Information
This project explores the intersection of art and computation through generative design. Using Processing, it creates layered compositions of geometric shapes including circles, rectangles, triangles and arcs rendered with a wide colour palette.
