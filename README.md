# Coding Geometric Art
This project aims to use code to recreate existing geometric art. The artworks are inspired by/recreations of Frank Stella's art.
Each shape, pattern and iteration represents the dialogue between human intention and computational logic, illustrating how algorithms can produce aesthetic outcomes that are a mix of systematic and expressive. By creating art with code, I challenged my previous ideal that generative art was invalid/lacked creativity.

## General Information
This project explores the intersection of art and computation through generative design. Using Processing, it creates layered compositions of geometric shapes including circles, rectangles, triangles and arcs rendered with a wide colour palette.
I aimed to challenge my own biased, rigid ideas that favoured classic styles of creativity - real-life painting, sculpting, performance.
By using code to honour this type of human-made art, I proved to myself that code and algorithms can in fact be creative. I now have a better understanding of how programming can function as an artistic medium, allowing myself to understand that code is not only technical but can also be cultural and meaningful. 
By creating this prototype project I also aimed to develop and demonstrate a new sense of code literacy by translating visual ideas into algorithmic logic. 

## Technologies Used
- Processing (Python mode) – 4.4.10 for macOS
- Processing libraries for colour management
- Various online resources including forums and cheatsheets provided.

## Room for Improvement
aka stretch goals:
- Implement user interaction (such as mouse or keyboard inputs) to alter shapes or colours dynamically.
- Incorporate animation or looping behaviour to explore motion.
- Experiment with how music could complement the visuals.

## Acknowledgements
I wish to acknowledge Frank Stella (1936-2024), whose artworks I based much of my project on. His usage of geometric patterns and shapes in creating paintings that evoke human emotions inspired my reiterations.

- thedotisblack.com acted as a huge inspiration for my early ideas, and provided tutorial videos that helped me generate ideas. 
- Thank you to the Processing community and open-source examples that guided my experimentation along the way. This project was very learn-as-I-go and I had access to an abundance of online opinions that helped greatly.
